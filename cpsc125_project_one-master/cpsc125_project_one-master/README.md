# CPSC125 Project One

Getting ready:
  - Create an account on github (for help with github, see https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/)
  - One person on your team should fork this repository: https://github.com/wkemmey/cpsc125_project_one
  - Add your team members as collaborators on your repository: https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/
  - Clone your new repository to your local machine so you can work on it

Complete the tty_graph.py program:
  - Comment and uncomment tickets and trains to try your program on a subset of trains and tickets
  - Write the find_path function
  - Add a function to print your trains and your tickets nicely formatted
  - Call these functions to print the input data right before you print the resulting score
  
Turn in your project! Send me an email with:
  - A link to your repository
  - The members of your team
  - Output from a run of your program with sample data of your choice (but non-trivial)
  
Git commands you will need:
  - git status -- shows you what has changed since your last commit
  - git add * -- adds changed files to your next commit
  - git commit -m "commit message" -- commits your changes and adds a nice descriptive message
  - git push origin master -- sends your committed changes to the repository on github
  - git pull -- updates your local copy of the repository with changes people have sent to github
  
There are lots of tutorials and guides available for git.  Here's a simple one: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

Don't worry about things like branching and tagging for this project.
